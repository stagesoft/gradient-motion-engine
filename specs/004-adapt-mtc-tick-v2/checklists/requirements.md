# Specification Quality Checklist: Adapt MtcTickSource to mtcreceiver v2.0.0

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- FR-002 references the new callback signature `void(long, bool)` as context for the adaptation; this is a dependency description, not an implementation detail.
- The 12 s / 1200-tick correction (FR-006, SC-003) is an explicit goal of this feature, not a pre-existing truth — marked in scope intentionally.
